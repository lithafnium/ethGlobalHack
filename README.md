By Leonard, Richard, and Steve.

What can AI researchers do for smart contract security? With the OpcodeFormer, we bring our past three years' of LLM knowledge and ML experience to solving the long-standing task of malicious contract detection. 

Critically, we serve our technology as part of a MetaMask Snap that protects all users from being scammed at the transaction level.

Here's a quick summary of what the OpcodeFormer does:
- Monitors smart contracts for potential malicious activity
- Prevents scams at the user interaction level with 100+ million parameter LLMs that obtain 99% accuracy on OOS test sets
- Seamlessly integrates with MetaMask Snaps
- Simulates and confirms flagged malicious transactions
